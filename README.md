# 3d-strange-attractors

Simple program to randomly generate 3D strange attractors (when you're lucky - you may have to randomize many times before coming across one).
Adjust the parameters of the system to see how slight changes morph the structure.
Click and drag to orbit around the structure and use the scroll wheel to zoom.
Use the high quality render option to accumulate more and more samples over time and fill out the image.
